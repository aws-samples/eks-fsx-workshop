## Workshop Objective

In this scenario-based workshop, we will focus on Amazon EKS and AWS storage services. We will take you through this journey to highlight how easily you can launch and use Amazon FSx fully managed file services to power your Amazon EKS Kubernetes container workloads. You will deploy a container-based workload with a persistent storage layer provisioned from Amazon FSx file services. This will help you to better understand the features, functionality and benefits provided by Amazon FSx. You will also touch on dimensions such as performance, scale, high availability, integration, and also data services which allow you to create clones of your DevOps data in seconds, or replicate and access your data seamlessly across AWS Regions, to further power at-scale the container-based workloads. We hope you will enjoy this fun learning experience with us.
