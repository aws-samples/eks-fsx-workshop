Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) is a fully managed service that makes it easy for you to run Kubernetes on AWS without needing to install, operate, and maintain your own Kubernetes control plane or nodes. Organizations often run a mix of stateless and stateful applications on a Kubernetes cluster. When it comes to stateful applications, there is often a trade-off between performance and availability for the external storage.

In this scenario-based workshop focused on Amazon EKS and AWS storage, we will take you through a journey to highlight how easily you can launch and use Amazon FSx fully managed file services to power your Amazon EKS Kubernetes container workloads. You will deploy a container-based workload with persistent storage from Amazon FSx to better understand the benefits Amazon FSx can provide. You will also touch on dimensions such as performance, scale, high availability, integration, and also data services which allow you to create clones of your DevOps data in seconds, or replicate and access your data seamlessly across AWS Regions, to further power at-scale container-based workloads.
