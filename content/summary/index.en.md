Congratulations on your successful completion of all the modules of this workshop. In this workshop you have learnt the key elements of integration of Amazon FSx family of file services with Amazon EKS cluster. Hope you had fun learning experience.

## Module 1 
You learnt how to deploy the trident operator, provision trident volume and run the containerized stateful mySQL app. You have performed additional steps how to backup & restore using the ONTAP method and EKS native method. You have run the performance load test on the storage layer and did failover test across availbility zones.  

## Module 2
You learnt how to deploy the CSI driver for Amazon FSx for Lustre filesystem and how to auto-provision the volume using the CSI driver. Configure the region level replication of data using Amazon S3 native replication method. This enables to make the data available across regions for the Amazon EKS cluster from the persistent storage layer. This provides an option to build regional level Business Continuity Plan or Disaster Recovery for the containerized workloads. 

## Module 3
You learnt how to deploy the CSI driver for Amazon FSx for OpenZFS filesystem and how to auto-provision the volume using the CSI driver. 

Finally, How to choose right storage for my use-case ?
